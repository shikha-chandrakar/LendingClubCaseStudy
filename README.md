## General Information
- This is a EDA project where we are dealing with data from a lending organization which has various parameters.
- The Data is from a consumer finance company where we have close to 39717 borrowers and on basis of this data we have to form insights.
- Based on the analysis and insights we have to decide whether to approve the loan or not.
- We are using loan.csv dataset which has more than 111 columns and 39717 rows.

## Conclusions
Considering all the above analysis multiple factors can be taken into account while accepting or rejecting the loan application.
1.Term: The duration of the loan. (The shorter the duration, the lower the chances of defaulters.)
2.Interest Rate: (The lower the interest rate, the higher the chances of loan repayment.)
3.Purpose: The purpose for which the loan is availed. Categories such as debt consolidation, credit card, home improvement, and small business are major areas where losses are more.
4.DTI: A higher Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is associated with a greater likelihood of default./li>
5.Address State: Certain states like CA (California) and FL (Florida) have high loan defaulters.
6.Years of Employment: The length of time a borrower has been employed can impact repayment likelihood.
7.Annual Income: (The higher the income, the higher the chances of repayment.)
8.Grades: Loans graded A and B have higher chances of repayment, while grades C, D, E, F, and G have the maximum defaulters.
9.Verification Status: We observe that defaulters are more prevalent in the 'Verified' and 'Source Verified' categories compared to 'Not Verified'. Thus, we can conclude that income verification or source verification does not guarantee loan repayment.
10.Loan Amount: (The higher the loan amount, the higher the chances of loan default.)
